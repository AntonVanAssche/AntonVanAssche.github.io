Hey there! I'm Anton Van Assche, a Linux System Administrator with a degree in
Applied Computer Science from Ghent University of Applied Sciences and Arts,
specializing in System and Network Administration. I work for Smals, seconded
to the Federal Pension Service of Belgium (Federale Pensioendienst België),
where I manage and optimize IT infrastructures with a focus on open-source tech
and automation.

In my free time, I enjoy working on [personal projects](/projects), ranging
from fine-tuning my Neovim, Hyprland, and Tmux configurations to writing small
Neovim plugins and creating tools like a password manager or a full-fledged
package manager in Bash. Some of these projects make their way to GitHub, while
others remain personal experiments, but most are open-source since that’s
something I value deeply.

Outside of tech, I’m a long-time épée fencer, training regularly and helping
teach younger fencers at my club, Schermkring Sint-Niklaas. Fencing keeps me
both mentally and physically sharp, and I find joy in contributing to the
community.

When I’m not working or fencing, I’m usually lost in music—anything from
[Tate McRae](https://www.tatemcrae.com/) to [Our Last Night](http://www.ourlastnight.com/)
keeps me going.

Feel free to check out my projects or connect if we share similar interests!
