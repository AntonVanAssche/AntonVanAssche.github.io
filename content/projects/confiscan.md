ConfiScan is a Bash script designed to collect basic information about Linux
systems and output it into a set of organized files (CSV and txt). This tool is
intended to assist system administrators in documenting and managing their
infrastructure, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of system
configurations.

The tool was initially developed as part of a bachelor thesis aimed at
exploring solutions to facilitate the transition to Infrastructur as Code
environments. Recognizing the ongoing challenges that many small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face, such as limited knowledge, time, and
budget constraints, ConfiScan will continue to be developed within this
repository. It provides a straightforward and effective method for collecting
and organizing system information, simplifying the creation of a comprehensive
configuration inventory.

More information about the initial script and backstory can be found at the
repository containing the thesis.
