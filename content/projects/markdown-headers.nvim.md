## Description

Markdow Headers is a lightweight and intuitive Neovim plugin designed to
enhance navigation within Markdown files. Whether you're creating study notes,
documentation, or any Markdown-formatted text, this plugin streamlines the
process of moving between sections and headings.

Markdown Headers emerged from my own struggles and frustrations while working
with extensive Markdown files during exam preparations. As a student who
heavily relies on Markdown for organizing and summarizing course materials,
navigating through numerous headings became a cumbersome task. This plugin is
my response to that challenge.

It exists to offer a practical solution for anyone who regularly works with
Markdown, whether for academic notes, technical documentation, or personal
projects. The goal is to make the Markdown editing experience in Neovim more
enjoyable and efficient, improving your productivity.

## Features

- [3] Boosted accuracy through the use of Treesitter for parsing Markdown and HTML
    structures.

    width, height, border characters, and the ability to control auto-closing
    behavior, and last but not least colors.
