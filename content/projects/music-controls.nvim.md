## Description

Music Controls is a Neovim plugin that allows you to easily control your
favorite music players from within Neovim. The plugin basically acts as a
wrapper around playerctl, a command-line utility that can control media
players. This makes almost any music player compatible with Music Controls,
ranging from Spotify to VLC, etc.

I created Music Controls to make it more convenient and efficient to control my
music player while working within Neovim. Instead of constantly switching
workspaces or opening a terminal to control my music player, I can use this
plugin to do it all within Neovim. You might say that I'm lazy, some say I'm not ðŸ˜‰!

I hope that others who have similar needs will find Music Controls useful as well.
