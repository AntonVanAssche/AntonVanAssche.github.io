                <p>
                    Hey there! My name is
                    <strong>Anton Van Assche</strong> and I'm currently a
                    <strong>student</strong> at the Ghent University of Applied
                    Sciences and Arts, where I'm studying
                    <strong>Applied Information Technology</strong>
                    specializing in System and Network administration.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em">
                    As a student, I'm constantly trying to improve my skills. I
                    am a big proponent of
                    <strong>open-source</strong> technology and use

                    (yes, this ugly creation was made within it üòÖ) in my daily
                    work. However, I also unfortunately use Windows mainly for
                    gaming (We got to destroy those n00bs in Call of Duty right?
                    üòè) and some school-related stuff.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em">
                    In my free time, I like to work on
                    <strong>personal projects</strong> and
                    <strong>tinker</strong> with my <strong>homelab</strong> (if
                    you can really call it one üòÑ). It consists of two Raspberry
                    Pi's. One serves as a server hosting a bunch of stuff like
                    <strong>Emby</strong>, <strong>Pihole</strong>,
                    <strong>Wireguard VPN</strong>, and much more. The second
                    one is a <strong>NAS</strong> configured in a
                    <strong>RAID 5</strong>
                    array using 4 SATA HDDs.

                    Another hobby of mine is

                        >√âp√©e</a
                    >), which means I get to stab people for
                    <strong>FUN</strong> üòÖ! I've been doing this for 10 years
                    now (yes I'm that <strong><del>OLD</del> YOUNG</strong>) and
                    I still love it. I am not currently competing in any
                    tournaments, but I do train twice a week with my club. I
                    might start competing again in some (regional) tournaments
                    in the future, but for now I am just enjoying the sport and
                    the people I meet through it.
                    <strong>Sooo engarde ü§∫!</strong>

                    know it's not the most impressive certification out there,
                    but I'm proud of it nonetheless! And hey it was free to take
                    the exam, due to my school üòÅ.
