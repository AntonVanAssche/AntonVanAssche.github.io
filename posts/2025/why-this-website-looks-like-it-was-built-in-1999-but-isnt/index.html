        <p>
          So yeah, you've noticed. My website is basic. Like, so basic it could be wearing Uggs and
          ordering pumpkin spice lattes. Yes, it looks like your high school IT teacher built it on
          a rainy Sunday in 1999. And yes - it's on purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          ...well, kind of.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>(Funny sidenote: I wasn't even born yet.)</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Honesty Hour</h2>
        <p>
          Could I build a modern, JavaScript-heavy, single-page-app that tracks your mouse
          movements, auto-plays video, and injects three different analytics scripts?
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, fine: no.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here's the trick: I don't need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me explain.
        </p>

        <h2>Speed &gt; Sparkles</h2>
        <p>
          This thing loads faster than your coffee machine can brew a cup. This site is so small,
          it could almost run on the original
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nokia 3310</a>.
          Okay, fine - maybe the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310_(2017)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 reboot</a>
          with
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Mini" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opera Mini</a>.
          But definitely not your average bloated JavaScript hellscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why? Because it's just HTML and CSS. No frameworks. No
          "optimized" webpack configs. No 50 npm dependencies for a dropdown menu with a bunch of
          vulnerabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>Small Is Sexy</h2>
        <p>
          This page is under 14kB. Fourteen. Kilobytes. That's smaller than most people's
          profile pictures. Hell, it's smaller than some emojis. Meanwhile, the average website out
          there is so obese it needs to be rolled onto the internet with a forklift.
        </p>

        <h2>Responsive Without the Buzzwords</h2>
        <p>
          Does it work on mobile? Yes. Does it work on your grandma's Windows XP box? Also yes.
          Does it need a 300-page Google developer doc explaining why? Nope. It just works. Because
          HTML and CSS have been doing that for decades.
        </p>

        <h2>Style-ish</h2>
        <p>
          Look, I'm not saying this is the sexiest website alive. But it has a vibe. Call it
          "minimalist", call it "retro", call it "my toaster could render this". It's clean, it's
          readable, and it's mine. Pretty darn <em>GORGEOUS</em>, if I say so myself.
        </p>

        <h2>No Bullshit</h2>
        <p>
          This site doesn't try to sell you an e-book. It doesn't pop up a cookie banner asking you
          to accept being tracked by 17 third-party ad networks. It doesn't autoplay a video of me
          pretending to be a thought leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's just words, links, and some mild CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
          So yeah, that's why it looks like this. It's a good f&#42;cking website. Inspired by
          <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a>,
          <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com</a>,
          and
          <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thebestmotherfucking.website</a>,
          it keeps things simple, fast, and, well... honest. No 30MB frameworks, no tracking
          scripts, no bullshit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you don't like it... go refresh one of those modern pages that takes longer to
          load than boiling pasta. This site doesn't try to impress anyone. It just works, looks
          decent, and doesn't waste your bandwidth.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it. Minimal, stylish-ish, unapologetically fast, and it doesn't beg for your
          email. A really good f&#42;cking website.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 0.75em; font-style: italic; color: #666;">
          P.S. If you didn't catch it yet - this post is mostly satire. I promise I'm not actually
          throwing shade at your toaster.
